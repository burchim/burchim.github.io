          Performed research to reduce end-to-end learning methods complexity in the area of ASR.
          
          Implemented, trained and evaluated state-of-the-art architectures from scratch using PyTorch.
          
          Developed an efficient architecture design inspired from previous works done in ASR and vision.
          
          Proposed a novel attention mechanism to reduce attention complexity without hurting performance.

        description: |
          The goal of this project was to create a mechanical orchestra composed of two music instruments controlled by microcontroller units connected to an iOS app. The project won the ”most technical project” prize awarded by Texas Instruments at the ESIEE Paris 2019 Project Days, an annual project competition where groups of students are invited to present their work to a jury.
